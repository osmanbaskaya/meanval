## Remaining work

### Open issues

- Write python script to divide data into train/validate/test. 
- Replace numbers, dates etc according to embedding's format (e.g, <NUMBER>)
- Add Tensorboard and check the current architecture works. (Convergence tests)
- Try different architecture and methodologies.
- Add some code to analyze the raw dataset. Some descriptor statistics etc.
- Find a good MT model to start with. 

### Done
- Use validation data to validate what model learns. Right now we're using training data for validation.
- Add code that prepare input/target values.
- Defactor the code. Remove all the code related with the tutorial.
