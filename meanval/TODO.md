## Remaining work

- Use validation data to validate what model learns. Right now we're using training data for validation.
- (50%) Defactor the code. Remove all the code related with the tutorial.
- (Donsies!) Add code that prepare input/target values.
- Add Tensorboard and check the current architecture works. (Convergence tests)
- Try different architecture and methodologies.
- Add some code to analyze the raw dataset. Some descriptor statistics etc.
